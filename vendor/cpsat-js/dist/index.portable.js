/**
 * Portable entry point — the default in browsers and any unrecognised runtime.
 *
 * Uses the single-threaded WASM build. It does not need `SharedArrayBuffer`, so it
 * works without cross-origin isolation, in Deno/Bun/edge runtimes, and from a plain
 * CDN `<script type="module">`.
 *
 * `numWorkers` is forced to 1 here. CP-SAT selects its subsolver portfolio by worker
 * count and 2 or 4 workers are measurably SLOWER than 1, so clamping to anything
 * other than 1 would be a performance bug.
